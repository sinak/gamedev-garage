        <p><strong>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Threshold we have a few fundamental principles:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We too are frustrated by services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no good reason.)</li>
          <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
          <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p><strong>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p>Threshold Future, Inc. (“<strong>Threshold</strong>”) operates several websites including threshold.is and sites built on top of its platform, such as isios7jailbrokenyet.com. It is Threshold's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      <p>Like most website operators, Threshold collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Threshold's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Threshold's visitors use its website. From time to time, Threshold may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Threshold also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users creating accounts. Threshold only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Certain visitors to Threshold's websites choose to interact with Threshold in ways that require Threshold to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Threshold gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at thresholdfund.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Threshold – by contributing to a prize campaign, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Threshold collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Threshold. Threshold does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
      <p>Threshold may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Threshold may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Threshold does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Threshold discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Threshold's behalf or to provide services available at Threshold’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Threshold's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Threshold will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Threshold discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Threshold believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Threshold, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Threshold's website and have supplied your email address, Threshold may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Threshold and our products. We primarily use our Twitter account and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it without personally-identifying information in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Threshold takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Threshold uses cookies to help Threshold identify and track visitors, their usage of Threshold's website, and their website access preferences. Threshold visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Threshold's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Threshold’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>If Threshold, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Threshold goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Threshold may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Threshold may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Threshold’s sole discretion. Threshold encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy, and will communicate to its users via its website and/or Twitter of any changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

      <h3>Learn More</h3>
      <p>If you'd like to learn more about why your privacy matters and what you can do to safeguard it, we suggest you check out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/" target="_blank">Mozilla's Lightbeam project </a> and Stanford's work on <a href="http://donottrack.us/" target="_blank">Do Not Track</a>.</p><br />
